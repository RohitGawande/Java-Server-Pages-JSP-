# JSP (JavaServer Pages) üíª

A dedicated repository to explore **JSP (JavaServer Pages)** as part of my **Full Stack Java Development Journey**. This repository contains structured examples, explanations, and hands-on projects that demonstrate how JSP works and integrates with the Java EE ecosystem.

## üìå About

This repository is built to help understand and implement core JSP concepts including:

- JSP Lifecycle & Architecture
- Directives (`page`, `include`, `taglib`)
- Scriptlets, Expressions, Declarations
- JSP Implicit Objects
- Error Handling with `errorPage` & `isErrorPage`
- Form Handling (GET & POST)
- Session Management
- JSTL & Expression Language (EL)
- JSP + JDBC Integration for real-world projects

Whether you‚Äôre a beginner exploring server-side rendering in Java or preparing for interviews, this repo is crafted for clear learning and hands-on practice.
